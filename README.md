# Personal Page

Repository for my personal page located at [rodalgaard.dk](http://rodalgaard.dk).

Minimalistic design with extended functionality hidden in body text.
* Dynamically resized background image thanks to [jquery-backstretch](https://github.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch).
* Responsive style with the help of [twitter bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
* Module loading with [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/).
* Build automation by [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).
* Package management by [bower](http://bower.io/).
